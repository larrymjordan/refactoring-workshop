# Swift
## Installing Swift

In order to use Swift, you must be running Xcode version 6.3 or greater which is available at [Apple's developer center](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/).

All exercises tested with Xcode 6.3 using Swift 1.2

## Running Tests

Test will run through the Xcode GUI using the XCTest framework.

### Creating the project in Xcode

These steps will use the `bob` exercise as an example. If you are not working on `bob`, replace `bob` with your exercise name in the steps below.

- Start Xcode and create a new project.

- Select iOS-->Application and then Single View Application and click Next.

- Enter Bob as your Product Name, set the language to Swift and then click Next.

- Accept the default settings for the remaining screens and finish creating your project.

- You will see two targets in your project, one for the application named `Bob` and one for tests named `BobTests`. If you chose to create an OSX application instead of an iOS application, you will not see a `BobTests` target and will have to create it manually.

- In the `BobTests` target, open the file named `BobTests.swift` replace the contents with the test file you got from exercism.

- Add a new file to the `Bob` target folder and name it `Bob.swift`.

- Select `Bob.swift` and in the File Inspector make sure that both `Bob` and `BobTests` are checked in the Target Membership area.

- Now use CMD-U to run the tests, and happy coding!
